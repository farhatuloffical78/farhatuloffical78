I am a passionate frontend developer with a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from Daffodil International University. I recently completed a 3-month remote web development internship, where I honed my skills in HTML, JavaScript (including ES6), CSS, Tailwind CSS, and React. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge by learning Next.js to enhance my capabilities further.In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong enthusiasm for continuous learning and keeping up with the latest trends in web development. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing cricket, which fuels my team spirit and dedication.
